To penetrate this orifice, insert a long-shank explorer in a mesiobuccoapical inclination into the point angle created at the juncture of the mesial wall, buccal wall, and sub pulpal floor of the pulp chamber.<br><br>• The mesiolingual orifice is located in a depression formed by the mesial and lingual walls. This orifice can be explored from a distobuccal direction. A groove usually connects the orifices of the MB and mesiolingual canals. The MB and mesiolingual orifices may be close together under the MB cusp.<br><br>• The distal orifice, which is oval in shape, with the widest diameter present in a buccolingual direction, can be explored by starting from a mesial direction. If the distal orifice is penetrated in a marked distobuccal or distolingual direction, one should seek an additional orifice and canal in the distal root. The multiple orifices in the distal root are usually found in the buccal and lingual portion of the ovoid coronal root canal.<br><br><strong>Root and Root Canal:</strong> Usually, two well-differentiated roots are present in the mandibular first molar, one mesial and one distal. Both roots are wide and flat buccolingually, with a depression in the middle of the root buccolingually.<br><br> This anatomic characteristic may be accentuated in the mesial root. A third root is found in some cases, either distally or mesially (5.3%), and is often referred to as the radix entomolaris.<br><br>The mesial root curves distally in 84% of cases and is straight in 16%. <br><br>The distal root is straight in 74% of cases, curves to the distal in 21%, and curves to the mesial in 5%.<br><br>Although the mandibular first molar has two roots, three canals are usually present. <br><br><strong>Mesial Root</strong>The mesial root has: <br><br>• Two canals that exit in two foramina in 41% of cases. <br><br>• Two canals that coalesce to exit in one foramen in 28% of cases.<br><br>• Two canals that coalesce to form one canal and bifurcate and exit in two foramina in 13% of cases.<br><br>• One canal that exits in one foramen in 12% of cases.<br><br>• One canal that bifurcates and exits in two foramina in 8% of cases.<br><br>• In rare cases, three canals exit in three foramina and this third canal which is present between the MB and mesiolingual canal orifices is referred to as the middle mesial canal.<br><br> <img class='image-center' src='./src/assets/Dental_Pulp/Sub_Categories/Mandibular_First_Molar.png' alt='Image-1'> <br> <strong>Distal Root</strong>The distal root has:<br><br>• One canal exiting in one foramen in 70% of cases.<br><br>• Two canals coalescing and exiting in one foramen in 15% of cases.<br><br>• One canal bifurcating and exiting in two foramina in 8% of cases.<br><br>• Two canals exiting in two foramina in 5% of cases.<br><br>• Two canals coalescing to form one canal and later bifurcating to exit in two foramina in 2% of cases.<br><br>In cross-section, all three canals are ovoid in the cervical and middle thirds and round in the apical third. Two canals present in the distal root are usually round in cross-section from the cervical third to the apical third.<br><br><strong>Clinical Note</strong>The mesial root of the mandibular first molar is in close proximity to the buccal cortical plate, whereas the distal root is centrally located.

These cytoplasmic bridges among odontoblasts may explain the palisading formation and the action in unison of these cells. These cell bodies vary in size, shape, and arrangement from the coronal pulp to the apical pulp. In the coronal pulp, the odontoblasts are tall, columnar cells with a nucleus polarized toward the center of the pulp.

The nerve bundles enter the pulp via the apical foramen/foramina and branch extensively especially in the coronal pulp. The pulp-dentin border zone in the peripheral pulp (pulp tips) is the most densely innervated area, where the nerve endings also extend the longest distance (100 - 150 um) into the dentinal tubules.</span> The pulpal blood flow mainly determines the speed of diffusion between the blood and the interstitial fluid; the higher the blood flow, the faster the diffusion. Regulation of an adequate blood flow is a crucial point for survival and normal function in any tissue.<br><br>i. Afferent circulation of the pulp consists of the arterioles entering the apical foramen. As these vessels traverse the center of the pulp, they branch into terminal arterioles, metarterioles, precapillaries, and finally capillaries. The capillaries end in the cell-poor zone and form a rich subodontoblastic plexus.<br><br>ii. Efferent circulation consists of postcapillary venules and collecting venules, which empty into two or three venules that exit through the apical foramina and empty into the vessels in the PDL. Lymphatic vessels follow this same pattern.<br>The function of blood vessels is to transport nutrients, fluids, and oxygen to the tissues and to remove metabolic waste from the tissues by maintaining an adequate flow of blood through the capillaries. This metabolic exchange occurs in the capillary bed.<br><br>The transfer of nutrients and metabolic waste through the capillary walls is controlled by the laws of hydrostatics and osmosis. The walls of the capillaries are an average of 0.5 μm thickness and serve as a permeable membrane that permits the exchange of fluids. The absorption of metabolic wastes and fluids prevents their accumulation in the pulpal tissues and also precludes increases in the pulpal tissue pressure.<br><br><img class='image-center' src='./src/assets/Zones_of_Pulp/Sub_Categories/Blood_Vessels_2.png' alt='Image-1'><br><strong>Citations</strong>BERGGREEN, E., BLETSA, A., & HEYERAAS, K.

                    "content": "<strong>Definition:</strong> Reversible pulpitis is a mild-to-moderate inflammatory condition of the pulp caused by noxious stimuli in which the pulp is capable of returning to the uninflamed state following removal of the stimuli.<br><br><strong>Types</strong>• Acute reversible pulpitis: The pain has been present for a short time (e.g., a few hours or days); however, it immediately ceases on removal of the aggravating stimuli.<br><br>• Chronic reversible pulpitis: The pain has been present for a long time (e.g., months); however, it immediately ceases on removal of the aggravating stimuli.<br><br><strong>Cause</strong>Reversible pulpitis may be caused by any agent that is capable of injuring the pulp. Specifically, the cause may be any of the following:<br><br>• Trauma, as from a blow or from a disturbed occlusal relationship<br><br>• Thermal shock, as from preparing a cavity with a dull bur or keeping the bur in contact with the tooth for too long, or as from overheating during polishing a filling.<br><br>• Excessive dehydration of a cavity or irritation of exposed dentin at the neck of a tooth.<br><br>• Placement of a fresh amalgam filling in contact with, or occluding, a cast restoration.<br><br>• Chemical stimulus, as from sweet or sour foodstuffs or from irritation of a filling; or bacteria, as from caries. <br><br>Following insertion of a restoration, patients often complain of mild sensitivity to temperature changes, especially cold. Such sensitivity may last 2-3 days or a week, or even longer, but it gradually subsides. This sensitivity is symptomatic of reversible pulpitis. <br><br>Local vascular congestion associated with common cold or with sinus disease can cause a generalized transient hyperaemia of the pulp of the maxillary posterior teeth. The irritant that causes hyperaemia or mild inflammation in one pulp may produce secondary dentin in another if the irritant is mild enough or if the pulp is vigorous enough to protect itself. <br><br><strong>Symptoms</strong>• Symptomatic reversible pulpitis is characterized by short, sharp pain lasting for a moment. <br><br>• This pain is always specific to a stimulus. <br><br>• The pain is instantly relieved on removal of the stimulus.<br><br>• It is more often brought on by cold than by hot food or beverages and by cold air. It does not occur spontaneously and does not continue when the cause has been removed. <br><br>The clinical difference between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is quantitative; the pain of irreversible pulpitis is more severe and lasts longer. In reversible pulpitis, the cause of the pain is generally traceable to a stimulus, such as cold water or a draft of air, whereas in irreversible pulpitis, the pain may come without any apparent stimulus. <br><br><strong>Diagnosis</strong>Diagnosis is by a study of the patient's symptoms and by clinical tests. The pain is sharp, lasts but a few seconds, and generally disappears when the stimulus is removed. Cold, sweet, or sour usually causes it. Pain may become chronic. <br><br>Although each paroxysm may be of short duration, the paroxysms may continue for weeks or even months. The pulp may recover completely, or the pain may last longer each time, and intervals of relief may become shorter, until the pulp finally succumbs. Because the pulp is sensitive to temperature changes, particularly cold, application of cold is an excellent method of locating and diagnosing the involved tooth. A tooth with reversible pulpitis reacts normally to percussion, palpation, and mobility, and the periapical tissue is normal on radiographic examination.<br><br><strong>Differential Diagnosis</strong>In reversible pulpitis, the pain is generally transitory, lasting a matter of seconds, whereas in irreversible pulpitis, the pain may last several minutes or longer. The patien's description of the pain, particularly regarding its onset, character, and duration, is often of inestimable help in arriving at a correct differential diagnosis. Thermal tests are useful in locating the affected tooth if unknown. The electric pulp test, using less current than on a control tooth, is an excellent corroborating test.<br><br><strong>Treatment</strong>The best treatment for reversible pulpitis is prevention. Periodic care to prevent the development of caries, early insertion of a filling if a cavity has developed, desensitization of the necks of teeth where gingival recession is marked, use of a cavity varnish or cement base before insertion of a filling, and care in tooth preparation and polishing are recommended to prevent pulpitis.<br><br> When reversible pulpitis is present, removal of the noxious stimuli will usually bring the pulp back to a healthy state. <br><br>Once the symptoms have subsided, the tooth should be tested for vitality to make sure that pulpal necrosis has not occurred. When pain persists despite proper treatment, the pulpal inflammation should be regarded as irreversible, the treatment for which is pulp extirpation.<br><br> <strong>Prognosis</strong> The prognosis for the pulp is favorable if the irritant is removed early enough; otherwise, the condition may develop into irreversible pulpitis."

As previously stated, reversible pulpitis may deteriorate into irreversible pulpitis.<br><br><strong>Symptoms</strong>• In the early stages of irreversible pulpitis, a paroxysm of pain may be caused by the following: sudden temperature changes, particularly cold; sweet or acid foodstuffs; and pressure from packing food into a cavity or suction exerted by the tongue or cheek.<br><br>• Symptomatic irreversible pulpitis exhibits pain usually caused by a hot or cold stimulus, or pain that occurs spontaneously. The pain persists for several minutes to hours, lingering after removal of the thermal stimulus.<br><br>• The pain often continues when the cause has been removed, and it may come and go spontaneously, without an apparent cause. <br><br>• The patient may describe the pain as sharp, piercing, or shooting, and it is generally severe.<br><br>• It may be intermittent or continuous, depending on the degree of pulpal involvement and on whether it is related to an external stimulus.<br><br>• The patient may also complain of postural pain, i.e., change of position (bending over or lying down) exacerbates the pain. This is due to the increase in intrapulpal pressure when the patient changes position from a standing posture to a supine (lying down) posture.<br><br>• The patient may also have pain referred to adjacent teeth, to the temple or sinuses when an upper posterior tooth is involved, or to the ear when a lower posterior tooth is affected.<br><br>• In later stages, the pain is more severe and is generally described as boring, gnawing, or throbbing, or as if the tooth was under constant pressure. The pulp need not be macroscopically exposed, but a slight exposure is generally present, or else the pulp is covered with a layer of soft, leathery decay. When no outlet is present, whether because of a covering of decay or a filling or because of food packed into a small exposure in the dentin, pain can be most intense.<br><br>• Patients are often kept awake at night by the pain (nocturnal pain), which continues to be intolerable despite all their efforts at analgesia. Pain is increased by heat and is sometimes relieved by cold, although continued cold may intensify the pain. After exposure and drainage of the pulp, pain may be slight, manifesting itself as a dull consciousness, or may be entirely absent. Pain can return if food packs into the cavity or underneath a leaky filling; it may not be as intense because of degeneration of the superficial nerve fibers.<br><br>• Apical periodontitis is absent, except in the later stages, when inflammation or infection extends to the periodontal ligament.<br><br><strong>Diagnosis</strong>Inspection generally discloses a deep cavity extending to the pulp or decay under a filling. The pulp may already be exposed. On gaining access to the exposure, one may see a greyish, scum-like layer over the exposed pulp and the surrounding dentin. This layer is composed of food debris, degenerated polymorphonuclear leukocytes, microorganisms, and blood cells. The surface of the pulp is eroded. An odor of decomposition is frequently present in this area. <br><br><img class='image-center' src='./src/assets/Classification/Sub_Categories/Irreversible_Pulpitis.png' alt='Image-1'> <br> Probing into the area is not painful to the patient until the deeper areas of the pulp are reached. At this level, both pain and haemorrhage may occur. If the pulp is not exposed by the carious process, a drop of pus may be expressed when one gains access to the pulp chamber. Radiographic examination may disclose an interproximal cavity not seen visually or may suggest involvement of a pulp horn. <br><br> <img class='image-center' src='./src/assets/Classification/Sub_Categories/Irreversible_Pulpitis_1.png' alt='Image-1'> <br> <img class='image-center' src='./src/assets/Classification/Sub_Categories/Irreversible_Pulpitis_2.jpg' alt='Image-1'> <br> A radiograph may also show exposure of the pulp, caries under a filling, or a deep cavity or filling threatening the integrity of the pulp. In the early stages of irreversible pulpitis, the thermal test may elicit pain that persists after removal of the thermal stimulus. <br><br>In the late stages, when the pulp is exposed, it may respond normally to a thermal stimulus, but generally it reacts feebly to heat and cold. The electric pulp test induces a response with a marked variation in current from the normal. Results of examination for mobility and percussion and palpation tests are negative. <br><br> <strong> Differential Diagnosis</strong> One must distinguish between reversible and irreversible pulpitis.<br><br> <strong> Clinical Note </strong>In reversible pulpitis, the pain produced by a thermal stimulus disappears as soon as the stimulus is removed, whereas in irreversible pulpitis, the pain lingers after the stimulus is removed, or it can occur spontaneously.<br><br> In the asymptomatic stage of irreversible pulpitis, the exposed pulp exhibits little or no pain, except when food is packed into the cavity. More current is required to elicit a response to the electric pulp test than in a control tooth.<br><br>In the early symptomatic stage, less current than what is normal is needed to elicit a response to the electric pulp tester, and the pulp is often abnormally responsive to a cold stimulus. The induced or spontaneous pain that occurs is sharp, piercing, and readily identified with a specific tooth. <br><br>Other symptoms may develop, such as diffuse, dull, constant pain, characterized by throbbing and gnawing, and the tooth may respond abnormally and severely to heat. This response is generally indicative of a later stage of irreversible pulpitis.<br><br>In this stage of irreversible pulpitis, the symptoms may simulate those of an acute alveolar abscess. Such an abscess, however, causes at least some of the following symptoms, which help to differentiate it from irreversible pulpitis: swelling, tenderness on palpation, tenderness on percussion, mobility of the tooth, and lack of response to pulp-vitality tests. In addition, the patient may have symptoms of systemic toxicity such as fever and nausea.<br><br>The pain of pulpitis is easy to localize by the patient at the onset. Once discomfort increases, the patient loses the ability to identify a particular tooth in the quadrant. A previous history of pain may help one to localize the origin of the pulpalgia. When pulpal pain is difficult to localize, the application of heat with a consequent abnormal response is indicative of irreversible pulpitis in that tooth.<br><br><strong>Treatment</strong>Treatment consists of complete removal of the pulp or pulpectomy. In posterior teeth, in which time is a factor, the removal of the coronal pulp or pulpotomy should be performed as an emergency procedure. Surgical removal should be considered if the tooth is not restorable. <br><br> <strong>Prognosis </strong> The prognosis of the tooth is favorable if the pulp is removed and if the tooth undergoes proper endodontic therapy and an appropriate post endodontic restoration. <br><br> The characteristic features distinguishing reversible and irreversible pulpitis are given in the table below: <br><br> <img class='image-center' src='./src/assets/Classification/Sub_Categories/Irreversible_Pulpitis_3.png' alt='Image-1'> <br>"
