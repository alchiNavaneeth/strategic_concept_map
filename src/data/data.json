The odontoblastic cell bodies form the odontoblastic zone, whereas the odontoblastic processes are located within the predentin matrix and the dentinal tubules, extending into the dentin. In this odontoblastic zone, capillaries and unmyelinated sensory nerves are found around the odontoblastic cell bodies. The odontoblasts lining the predentin represent the link between the dentin and the pulp. They are the matrix-producing cells and show characteristic features associated with protein synthesis."

As the dentinal tubules approach the dentinoenamel junction, they branch and increase the ratio per unit area over that of the middle third of the dentin. The branching of the dentinal tubules occurs during the beginning of dentinogenesis. Each preodontoblast sends various cytoplasmic processes into the acellular zone and thereby produces several future dentinal tubules. As the fully mature odontoblast migrates pulpally, the processes unite to form a single dentinal tubule with terminal branches at the dentinoenamel junction. This branching may explain the extreme sensitivity of the Dentinoenamel junction. Because the peritubular dentin has an organic matrix with fewer collagen fibers than the intertubular dentin, it is more mineralized and harder. As the pulp ages, the continuous deposition of peritubular dentin may obliterate the dentinal tubules peripherally.

The capillary plexus is involved in the nutrition of the odontoblasts and the cells of the zone and is conspicuous only during periods of dentinogenesis and inflammation. The ground substance is involved in the metabolic exchanges of the cells and limits the spread of infection because of its consistency.

They are conical in shape, with a 2.5 μm mean diameter in the pulpal wall and a 0.9 μm mean diameter in the dentinoenamel or dentinocemental junctions because of the deposition of the peritubular dentin. As the dentinal tubules approach the dentinoenamel junction, they branch and increase the ratio per unit area over that of the middle third of the dentin. The branching of the dentinal tubules occurs during the beginning of dentinogenesis. Each preodontoblast sends various cytoplasmic processes into the acellular zone and thereby produces several future dentinal tubules. As the fully mature odontoblast migrates pulpally, the processes unite to form a single dentinal tubule with terminal branches at the dentinoenamel junction. This branching may explain the extreme sensitivity of the Dentinoenamel junction. Because the peritubular dentin has an organic matrix with fewer collagen fibers than the intertubular dentin, it is more mineralized and harder. As the pulp ages, the continuous deposition of peritubular dentin may obliterate the dentinal tubules peripherally. This obliteration of tubules results in the formation of the sclerotic dentin, which has a glassy appearance under transmitted light."

They are conical in shape, with a 2.5 μm mean diameter in the pulpal wall and a 0.9 μm mean diameter in the dentinoenamel or dentinocemental junctions because of the deposition of the peritubular dentin. As the dentinal tubules approach the dentinoenamel junction, they branch and increase the ratio per unit area over that of the middle third of the dentin. The branching of the dentinal tubules occurs during the beginning of dentinogenesis. Each preodontoblast sends various cytoplasmic processes into the acellular zone and thereby produces several future dentinal tubules. As the fully mature odontoblast migrates pulpally, the processes unite to form a single dentinal tubule with terminal branches at the dentinoenamel junction. This branching may explain the extreme sensitivity of the Dentinoenamel junction. Because the peritubular dentin has an organic matrix with fewer collagen fibers than the intertubular dentin, it is more mineralized and harder. As the pulp ages, the continuous deposition of peritubular dentin may obliterate the dentinal tubules peripherally. This obliteration of tubules results in the formation of the sclerotic dentin, which has a glassy appearance under transmitted light."

Some studies claim that these processes extend into one-third of the thickness of the dentin (0.7 mm), whereas others claim that the processes extend through the thickness of the dentin and reach the Dentinoenamel junction. The space around the odontoblastic processes, the periodontoblastic space, and the space peripheral to the end of the odontoblastic processes are filled with extracellular fluid.

They are conical in shape, with a 2.5 μm mean diameter in the pulpal wall and a 0.9 μm mean diameter in the dentinoenamel or dentinocemental junctions because of the deposition of the peritubular dentin. As the dentinal tubules approach the dentinoenamel junction, they branch and increase the ratio per unit area over that of the middle third of the dentin. The branching of the dentinal tubules occurs during the beginning of dentinogenesis. Each preodontoblast sends various cytoplasmic processes into the acellular zone and thereby produces several future dentinal tubules. As the fully mature odontoblast migrates pulpally, the processes unite to form a single dentinal tubule with terminal branches at the dentinoenamel junction. This branching may explain the extreme sensitivity of the Dentinoenamel junction. Because the peritubular dentin has an organic matrix with fewer collagen fibers than the intertubular dentin, it is more mineralized and harder. As the pulp ages, the continuous deposition of peritubular dentin may obliterate the dentinal tubules peripherally. This obliteration of tubules results in the formation of the sclerotic dentin, which has a glassy appearance under transmitted light."
