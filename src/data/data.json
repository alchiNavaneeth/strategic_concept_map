This zone, although called cell-free, contains some fibroblasts, mesenchymal cells, and macrophages. Fibroblasts are involved in the production and maintenance of the reticular fibers found in this zone. When odontoblasts are destroyed by noxious stimuli, mesenchymal cells and fibroblasts differentiate into new odontoblasts. Macrophages are present for the phagocytosis of debris. The main constituents of this zone are a plexus of capillaries, the nerve plexus of Raschkow, and the ground substance. The capillary plexus is involved in the nutrition of the odontoblasts and the cells of the zone and is conspicuous only during periods of dentinogenesis and inflammation. The ground substance is involved in the metabolic exchanges of the cells and limits the spread of infection because of its consistency. The zone of Weil is more prominent in the coronal pulp, but it may be completely absent during periods of dentinogenesis."
